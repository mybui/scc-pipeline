# SCC Data Engineering project: ETL and visualisation

## Run the visualisation dashboard

Run these commands to open the dashboard.

*You might have to run this command again*
*in case it doesn't show all images properly in the first time.*

```shell
make run-streamlit
```

## Run the entire ETL pipeline and the dashboard

*You don't need to do this as we already pull all data.*

```shell
make run-all
```
